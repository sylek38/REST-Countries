# REST-Countries

That's a website project with **a table of information about various countries**.

You can filter the information by **keyword, minimal and maximal value**, the table also provides a feature of **sorting** the data in ascending-descending order by clicking on column's name. The other part of the website is **Dashboard**, there you can find some information about countries. It is just to add some more complexity to the project

As you can see, some visual aspects are still in progress :nail_care:

Countries information come from an API ---> https://restcountries.com
